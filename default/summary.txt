  In our last session, we discussed your values and beliefs and explored how they can help you find meaning and purpose in your life. We identified activities that bring you joy and satisfaction, and discussed potential options for meaningful activities that incorporate these things. We also discussed a good first step for you to take. Is there something that stood out to you that you would like to focus on?
